    <h1>Welcome to Puzzle Reviews</h1>
    <p> There are many puzzles in the world. Some are difficult, some have pieces that don't fit
        together quite right, and some cost a lot. Some have art worth going through all the trouble
        to put it together. Others don't. Have you ever wanted someone's <strong>subjective</strong> 
        and <strong>biased</strong> opinion on all these qualities and more? No? <strong>Too bad!</strong>
        You came to this site of your own free will. Welcome to Puzzle Reviews.
